This game is built off of SpriteKit technology. At the start of the game, there will be 1 or 2 players who are "infected". Their goal is to infect the other players. The other players have to avoid becoming infected through the using of powerups, abilities, and outmanuevering the "infected". As of right now, a connection to the AWS DynamoDB is being setup using cocoapods.
